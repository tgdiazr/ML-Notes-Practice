# ML-Notes-Practice
 
This repository contains my notes, code examples, and practice solutions as I study machine learning concepts, algorithms, and system design.

## ðŸ“‚ Structure
- `supervised-learning/`: Logistic Regression, Random Forests, Evaluation Metrics, etc.
- `unsupervised-learning/`: k-Means, PCA, Probability & Statistics, etc.
- `deep-learning/`: Neural Networks, CNNs, RNNs
- `advanced-models/`: Transformers, BERT, Reinforcement Learning
- `coding-practice/`: LeetCode and other coding exercises
- `system-design-and-papers/`: ML system design concepts and paper reviews
- `interview-prep/`: Behavioral and technical interview preparation
- `application-prep/`: Resume and networking tips

## âœ¨ Purpose
This repo serves as:
- A personal learning log
- A portfolio of machine learning practice
- A resource for others learning similar topics

## ðŸ“Œ Notes
Each topic folder contains:
- `notes.md`: key concepts, theory, and references
- `.ipynb` or `.py`: code demos or solutions
